The goal of my final year thesis project was to design a self-encrypting USB based hardware password manager. Single sign on (SSO) capability was also another requirement for the project. SSO capability allows an end user to log into any of their online accounts through a single, unified interface. Credentials were required to be securely stored in an encrypted form and then subsequently decrypted during an SSO login session. 

The solution to this problem involved utilizing two ATMega328P microcontrollers. The first microcontroller, termed the auxiliary microcontroller implemented a RSA-1024 cryptographic module as well as a custom EEPROM based filesystem to store encrypted credentials using the Arduino software stack and bootloader. Next a USB CDC ACM device class was implemented in firmware using the V-USB driver stack and flashed onto another ATMega328P microcontroller, termed the USB microcontroller. The auxiliary and USB microcontrollers UART transcivers when then connected together to enable serial communications between both microcontrollers. On Linux, CDC ACM devices appear as virtual serial ports (/dev/ttyACM*) and this finally allowed for virtual serial communications between the host PC and the auxilliary microcontroller via the USB microcontroller.

A software client was then developed and consisted of a chrome browser extension to manage credentials through a UI interface as well as a native host (using google chromes native messsaging API) to enable serial communication between the chrome browser extension and the auxiliary microcontroller. The native host was also responsible for decrypting credentials as well as generating RSA keys and made use of OpenSSL's C API for these tasks.

This repository consists of three sub branches (folders):
* /Firmware - source code for the auxiliary and USB driver MCU.
* /Software - source code for the browser extension and native host.
* /Report - latex (overleaf) source code of report.
