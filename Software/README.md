# Installation of Browser Extension

Firstly enable developer mode within chrome by navigating to chrome://extensions and clicking on the 'Developer Mode' checkbox.
Then select the 'Load unpacked' button within the same view and select the folder /Software/Browser Extension. Finally note the extension ID
as this is an important parameter that is required for the installation of the native host.

# Installation of Native Host

Mark the build.sh and install.sh scripts as executable within a terminal and run thie build.sh script. A binary file named **nativehost** will be created within the
same folder. Next modify the file com.secure.pass.json to include the ID of the extension created earlier along with the full path of the nativehost binary created
earlier. Finally run install.sh.
